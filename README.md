## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
 * w3 school tutorials, Stack Overflow, Visual Studio Code.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
* Putting everything together was hard. I had to make sure that any change I made didn't affect the other code, html, css, js.  
* It was challenging to keep time for working on the submission since I have other engagements. I overcame this by doing the submission in parts. 
* It was challenging to debug JavaScript since I didn't have much experience on it. Adding a new feature neeed me to be careful and ensured it worked perfectly. I overcome this through keeping track of my changes and using console log to debug.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
* How to link a website to a database and be able to perform actions such as view records, update records, and delete records. 
* How to create a dynamic website with a backend and integrate them to work seamlessly.
* The best practices for designing a website with multiple pages. How to create designs before even writing the code. 
* How to secure a website through hiding some aspects from the user.
* How to ensure that the website is responsive across different devices.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
* I would develop the game to be even more interactive by adding levels. Users progress by completing the sequences. Increase difficulty per level.
* Adding musical notes such that when the user is pressing the buttons, it emulates a real piano.
* Add a leaderboard feature where users can include their names before playing the game. The game will record their score and record in a live leaderboard. This will make the game fun.
* Develop a mobile version so that users can play the game on their phones.
* I would the feature so that the users can hear the musical notes, all eight, after the game.
